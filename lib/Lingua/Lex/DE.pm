=head1 NAME

Lingua::Lex::DE - Subclasses Lingua::Lex with specific German lexicography

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

This essentially is L<Lingua::Lex> with the addition of a default database that consists of the German language and
morphology. This allows the morphological rules for German to be tested independently of L<Lingua::Lex>.

Some specific functionality may end up implemented here. For example, German apophony (the "umlautification" of
roots when they're declined or conjugated in various ways, like rot -> r√∂tlich) is probably German-specific enough
that there might not be much motivation to build a generalized rule system that could handle it and that would
then be standard equipment for Lingua::Lex. So at least initially, that kind of morphological transformation
might make sense here in Lingua::Lex::DE, and certainly there should be a well-supported mechanism to permit that
for others who want to develop purpose-specific or language-specific lexica.

For now, though, Lingua::Lex::DE doesn't actually do I<anything> except be Lingua::Lex with a more specific name,
a default lexical source directory, and a distribution that permits separate testing of its lexical rules.

Since everything (including the data location) defaults out to reasonable values, you can probably use it just like this:

   use Lingua::Lex::DE;

   my $lex = Lingua::Lex::DE->new();
   my $tok = $lex->word('unangenehm');
   # $tok is now ['aa', 'unangenehm', 'un+angenehm']

The first time you call the module, it will build the database for live lookup. On my machine, this takes about ten minutes -
the basic lexicon contains over 83,400 root words, so it's just plain a massive amount of data.

(As a result, testing is disabled for CPANtesters. That's a lot to ask of anonymous testing platforms. So if there are
some platform incompatibilities, please tell me.)

=head1 DEFAULT OVERRIDES

=head2 default_filename

We'll use "de.sqlt" as the default filename, and if there is a shared module directory to which we have write
access, we'll use that as the path.

=cut

sub default_filename {
    my $lexdir = eval { File::ShareDir::module_dir('Lingua::Lex::DE'); };
    return 'de.sqlt' if @!;
    return $lexdir . '/de.sqlt';
}

=head2 default_lexicon

The default lexicon for the German language is installed into the shared module directory during installation.
That path is returned here.

=cut

sub default_lexicon {
    my $lexdir = eval { File::ShareDir::module_dir('Lingua::Lex::DE'); };
    return if @!;
    return $lexdir;
}

=head2 default_stoppos

This returns the list of parts of speech that are considered stopwords in this lexicon. At present those are
'art', 'conj', and 'prep'.

=cut

sub default_stoppos { ('art', 'conj', 'prep'); }
