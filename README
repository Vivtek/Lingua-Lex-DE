Lingua-Lex-DE

Lingua-Lex-DE

This subclass of Lingua::Lex includes a full (but still very immature) lexicon for
the German language. It can be used for spell checking, POS tagging, and feeding
into a parser.

The current state of affairs is very raw; I used the igerman98 spell checker for
an initial vocabulary and morphological rules, and hope to firm things up going
forward. As a result, the part-of-speech information is very incomplete and
so are the morphological rules. So use it with the caveat that it's going to
fail to recognize a lot of words, and could very well give you wrong information
about many others.

It should get better over time. Help would naturally be welcome.

During installation, the dictionary is installed to a module shared directory;
if possible, it also attempts to build the working database there for ease of
use.
